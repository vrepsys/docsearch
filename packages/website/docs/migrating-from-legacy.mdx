## Introduction

With the new version of the [DocSearch UI](/docs/DocSearch-v3), we wanted to go further and provide better tooling for you to create and maintain your config file, and some extra Algolia features that you all have been requesting for a long time!

## What's new?

### Scraper

The DocSearch infrastructure now leverages the [Algolia Crawler](https://www.algolia.com/products/search-and-discovery/crawler/). We've teamed up with our friends and created a new [DocSearch helper](/docs/record-extractor), that extracts records as we were previously doing with our beloved [DocSearch scraper](/docs/legacy/run-your-own)!

The best part, is that you no longer need to install any tooling on your side if you want to maintain or update your index!

We now provide [a web interface](https://crawler.algolia.com/) that will allow you to:

- Start, schedule and monitor your crawls

- Edit your config file from our live editor

- Test your results directly with [DocSearch v3](/docs/DocSearch-v3)

### Algolia application and credentials

We've received a lot of requests asking for:

- A way to manage team members

- Browse and see how Algolia records are indexed

- See and subscribe to other Algolia features

## FAQ

You can find answers related to the DocSearch migration in our [Crawler FAQ page](/docs/crawler).

## Config file key mapping

Below are the keys that can be found in the [`legacy` DocSearch configs](/docs/legacy/config-file) and their translation to an [Algolia Crawler config](https://www.algolia.com/doc/tools/crawler/apis/configuration/). More detailed documentation of the Algolia Crawler can be found on the [the official documentation](https://www.algolia.com/doc/tools/crawler/getting-started/overview/)
